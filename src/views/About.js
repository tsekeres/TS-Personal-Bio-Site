          I am a Physical Education Teacher of 20 years with a Master&apos;s
          degree in Educational Leadership. I love to teach skills and enjoy
          &quot;aha moments&quot; more than anything in life. Both for myself and
          for those I am teaching. I&apos;ve often been told that I&apos;m good at
          explaining things. I think this is because I love breaking down physical skills or concepts into logical, buildable steps or chunks. This is highly
          relateable to coding in specific and teamwork in general. The
          development process and the teamwork environment is full of the logical,
          broken down elements that I enjoy and that make sense to me. It is also
          full of those personal and team &quot;aha moments&quot; that bring so much
          joy. I want to explore the development world to use my skills and
          talents in a new environment. I want to solve mysteries, straighten
          crooked pathways, rebuild bridges that are broken and find the aha
          moments that lie in wait.
